Invitation to Coders & Collaborators<br>
If you're passionate about open-source development, AI integrations, or creating a modular platform, we invite you to join this exciting project. As a coder, youâ€™ll have the opportunity to build core features or contribute addons through GitHub repos. We are particularly interested in Flutter developers for the main app, but all coding backgrounds are welcome for addon creation.
<br><br>

Addon Development Notes for Developers<br>
Each addon will live in a separate GitHub repository, allowing flexibility for developers. Major coding languages are acceptable since the core app will integrate the addons into the platform (support for iOS and Android). If needed, tools for code conversion between platforms can be used to ease the process for single-platform developers.
<br><br><br>


## Note to Investors<br>
While this is an open-source project, there is significant potential for monetization through premium features, addons, and community growth. If youâ€™re interested in investing in a scalable and AI-powered platform with a growing user base, weâ€™d love to hear from you. We aim to make this project a cornerstone for self-insight.
