<br>

This open-source project aims to build a mobile-first platform focused on self-improvement, group challenges, and community engagement. By leveraging video and text delivery, AI recommendations, and modular addons, the platform will foster healthier habits and provide personalized insights for users.

Purpose of the App
The app is designed to help users track their progress, participate in group challenges, and discover new habits through AI-driven recommendations. With a focus on gamified experiences and social sharing, users can enhance their journey toward self-improvement.

Goals of the Project
Build a cross-platform app using Flutter (Android, iOS, Web) with a focus on user experience.
Allow third-party developers to create custom addons and extensions for additional functionality.
Provide a secure, scalable backend with real-time data syncing and analytics.
Open-source development to foster community contributions and innovations.
Estimated Start Date
We aim to kick off development by [insert date], with an early beta release targeted within [timeline].

Invitation to Coders & Collaborators
If you're passionate about open-source development, AI integrations, or creating a modular platform, we invite you to join this exciting project. As a coder, you’ll have the opportunity to build core features or contribute addons through GitHub repos. We are particularly interested in Flutter developers for the main app, but all coding backgrounds are welcome for addon creation.

Addon Development Notes for Developers
Each addon will live in a separate GitHub repository, allowing flexibility for developers. Major coding languages are acceptable since the core app will integrate the addons into the platform (support for iOS and Android). If needed, tools for code conversion between platforms can be used to ease the process for single-platform developers.

Licensing
We’re offering an open license for community contributors, with a private license option for those interested in specific customizations or commercial use. More detailed licensing info will be provided on the GitHub repository page.

Note to Investors
While this is an open-source project, there is significant potential for monetization through premium features, addons, and community growth. If you’re interested in investing in a scalable and AI-powered platform with a growing user base, we’d love to hear from you. We aim to make this project a cornerstone for self-improvement apps in the marketplace.
